Day Thirteen Direct Messaging 

Today's design is about Direct Messaging. I decided to go with something simple - messaging within the mobile app BridgeTech (my product project). Similar to Slack, if the user clicks the icon, s/he can see the whole list of contacts. Clicking the right-arrow icon allows users to see the images they have shared, and clicking the menu icon allows them to see setting. The color I chose for the messaging interface aligns with the BridgeTech mobile app.
