Day Six User Profile

This is a user profile of a Game of Thrones character Cersei Lannister in a video game. 

In the user profile, there are 5 main components - 
1. The background picture is based on the location of the character, and in this case, it's 
King's landings. 

2. The profile picture, which I used mask to create. 

3. The third part is the name of the character and the geolocation. 

4. The status of the character. In this case, I just randomly used strength (ability to fight), 
intelligence (strategy) and energy (how long the character is likely to survive). I used radiant 
to indicate the score of each element. 

5. The follow button. In the game, it's assumed that you can follow other characters for different 
purposes such as looking for multiplayers in the future.
