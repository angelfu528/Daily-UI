# Daily-UI

This is a design challenge organized by Daily UI. Everyday I will receive an element for mobile and web designs. At this point, I aim to enhance my design skill (using Sketch) and understanding of creating great user experience over the course of 30 days or longer. The original challenge was supposed to last for 100 days, but since I am also working on other personal projects, I will upload the first 30 designs as the first part of this challenge. 

If you would like to check out some of these designs, feel free to browse the folders in this repo. In each folder, you will find the design along with the description of the context in an html file. 

If you would like to provide feedback on some of the designs or have any questions, feel free to create an issue! I am fairly new to design, so any feedback or comment is welcome!
