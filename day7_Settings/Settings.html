Day Seven Settings 

This is a design of the settings page for my product project BridgeTech, a contractor management tool. It consists of 4 compononents - 

1. A status bar. 

2. A head bar includes the page name and functions that allow users to exit the settings page and log out of the app. 

3. 4 sections that allow users to edit their profile, learn about how to use the app, provide feedback on the app, etc. I group these sections based on the purpose. For example, the first section is about general information, which includes the user profile and the current plan his or her company is using with BridgeTech. 

4. A profile picture.
