Day Fifteen On/Off Switch 

The goal of this design is to make two opposite colors go well together. Since this is an on/off switch, I created a "do not disturb" context, and used sun/yellow and cloudy night/blue as the background. As the user clicks the switch, the color of the oval will change depending on which side it's sliding to.
