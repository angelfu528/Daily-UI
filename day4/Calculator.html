Day Four Calculator

This is a calculator with slighly different functions. I always want to be able to use parenthesis in a normal calculator so that I can use multiple functions in one calculation. I include a back parenthesis in this calculator. When the user hits the back parenthesis, everything before the parenthesis will become the first step of the calculation. 

I also include the menu and history buttons. With the normal calculators, we usually can't see the history of calculations. If the user hits the history button in this calculator, s/he will be able to see the history of all calculations, and select the specific one. It's assumed that the history will clear up after every 20 calculations. 

With the menu button, the user can change the theme of the calculator and see the help page.
