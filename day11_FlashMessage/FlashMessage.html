Day Eleven Flash Message

A flash message usually has two types of content - success vs error. In order to be more creative in this design, 
I use the Hunger Games as the context. If the candidate is accepted to the hunger games, s/he will see a message with 
Katniss' sad face, because the person has to participate in the game and might not make it back. Vice versa,
if the candidate doesn't get selected, s/he will see a message with Katniss' smily face. 

On top of adding the emotions that can help users identify the type of message, I also use color (red vs blue) in the 
messages to make the tone stronger.
