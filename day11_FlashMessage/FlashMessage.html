Day Eleven Flash Message

The context of this design is about a user trying to a book trip to San Francisco. Therefore, the background image is a picture taken in SF. Since this is about travel/vacation, I decided to use weather icons to present success and failure instead. Therefore, the choice of the colors is also different than what normally people use - red and green, because I tried to align the color of the messages with the color of the icons.
