Day Twelve E-commerce Shop (Single Item)

Today's challenge is about a single item from an online shopping website. I chose Warby Parker to be the website 
and I used blue as the main color of this page because it aligns with the brand color. 

There are 2 parts of the card. On the left side, it includes mostly the images of the glasses for customers to browse. 
On the right side, it's the information about the glasses such as style name, price, colors available and some other 
information. Since this item is about a pair of glasses, I also included "measurements" to indicate that people can 
have a better idea of the size of the glasses.
